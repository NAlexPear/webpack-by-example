# Webpack By Example

A series of Webpack configurations meant to explain the core concepts of Webpack by example. To run any example, `cd` into that project directory and run `npm install && npm start`. Simple examples can be seen by previewing the `index.html` file, and more complex examples will serve the result locally.

These examples accompany [this presentation](https://presentations.alexpear.com/decks/1/).
